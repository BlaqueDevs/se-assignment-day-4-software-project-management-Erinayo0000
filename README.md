## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile and Waterfall are two distinct software development methodologies, each with its own approach to project management and execution.  

Agile is an iterative and flexible approach that emphasizes collaboration, adaptability, and continuous feedback. It breaks projects into smaller increments called sprints, allowing teams to deliver functional components frequently. Agile is highly responsive to changing requirements, making it ideal for dynamic projects where customer needs evolve over time. However, Agile requires close coordination between team members and stakeholders, which can be challenging if communication is poor. Additionally, the lack of a fixed plan can sometimes lead to scope creep, where new features continuously expand the project’s scope, affecting deadlines and budgets.  
Waterfall, on the other hand, follows a linear and structured approach, where each phase (requirements, design, development, testing, and deployment) must be completed before moving to the next. It works best for projects with clear, well-defined requirements that are unlikely to change. Waterfall provides strong documentation and clear timelines, making it easier to manage large teams and ensure accountability. However, its rigidity makes it difficult to accommodate changes once development has started. If an issue is discovered late in the process, fixing it can be costly and time-consuming. Additionally, because testing happens at the end, errors might not be identified early, leading to potential project failures or delays.  
In summary, Agile offers flexibility and faster delivery of functional components but requires strong communication and careful scope management. Waterfall provides a structured, predictable process but struggles with adaptability to changes. The choice between the two depends on the project's complexity, requirements, and need for flexibility.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
